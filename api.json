      "summary": "A malevolent female spirit from Malaysian folklore characterized by extremely long, pendulous breasts used to suffocate victims. One of the most feared supernatural entities in Malay ghost taxonomy, particularly dreaded in rural communities.",
      "full": "Hantu Tetek is a distinctive female entity in Malaysian supernatural tradition, recognized by her grotesquely elongated breasts that can reach several feet in length. According to folklore, she appears as an old woman with sagging skin and disheveled hair, using her unnaturally long breasts as weapons to smother and suffocate victims, particularly children and men. The entity is believed to haunt remote areas, abandoned houses, and dark forests, attacking lone travelers at night. Within Malaysian ghost hierarchy, Hantu Tetek represents a cautionary figure warning against venturing into isolated areas after dark. The phenomenon reflects cultural anxieties about female aging, sexuality, and the dangers of wilderness areas."
