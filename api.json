      "summary": "Hantu Tetek (lit.",
      "full": "Hantu Tetek (lit. \\\"breast ghost\\\") is one of the most distinctive and feared entities in Malaysian supernatural folklore. Characterized by grotesquely elongated breasts that can extend several feet in length, this malevolent female spirit appears as an elderly woman who uses her unnaturally long breasts as weapons to suffocate victims, particularly lone travelers and children. Within the rich taxonomy of Malay hantu (ghosts), Hantu Tetek occupies a unique position as both a cautionary figure and a representation of cultural anxieties surrounding female aging, sexuality, and the dangers of isolated places. The entity is believed to haunt abandoned buildings, dark forests, and remote areas, emerging primarily at night to hunt for victims. While contemporary sightings have declined with urbanization, belief in Hantu Tetek persists in rural areas and traditional communities. The entity maintains cultural relevance through storytelling, popular media, and its integration into Islamic-Malay cosmology as a jinn manifestation."
